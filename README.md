# Dataset
-The datasets contains a set of tweets which have been divided into a training and a test set. The training set contains a target column identifying whether the tweet pertains to a real disasteror not./
-Our job is to create a ML model to predict whether the test set tweets belong to a disaster or not, in the form of 1 or 0. This is a     classic case of a Binary Classification problem.
